#### Problems I faced while creating the webapp
1. Removing unwanted Javascript from the fetched data
2. Extracting only the required text from the response so generated

#### Future Ideas & Optimizations for Implementation in the project
1. Error Handling - Currently it does not render data from PDF files
2. Time Optimization - It takes good amount of time to get all the data together
3. UI - Building an understandable and representable UI
